# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
PyBer Analysis aims to provide the client with a comprehensive analysis of ride share data. The scope of the anaylysis included creating a new summary dataframe through visualization via a multi-line chart of total weekly fares by city type. This analysis enables the ride share executives to make informed decisons based on the weekly fare breakdowns. 

## Results:
PyBer Analysis provides insight into key client specific data points by city types; Urban, Suburban, and Rural. The data was analyzed and broken down into a summarized dataframe and finally a multi line graph to provide data visualization for the client. The line graph thoroughly tells the PyBer story. 

By reviewing the dataframe below we can see the majority of Pyber revenues come from Urban cities. Urban cities account for the highest number of rides, total drivers, and total fares. The opposite is true for Rural cities, these cities account for the lowest total rides, drivers and fares. Urban and Rural citites switch positions when it comes to average fare per ride and fare by driver. Urban cities have the highest average fare by ride and driver, Urban cities have the lowest. Suburban cities remain in the middle of the pack.

## Summary:

Following the PyBer analysis there are three business recommendations for executive review. 
 * 1. Complete further demographic analysis of Suburban and Rural ride share users to create a marketing strategy to increase utiliation and drivers within those cities. 
 * 2. Implement a marketing campaign or rewards program for weeks of the month with lowest utilization based on fares. 
 * 3. Complete a cost benefit analysis on continuing to serve Rural cities to determine if the resources required to maintain the app within those cities provides any payoff to the company.
